For the setup, two scripts have to be started :

  ./code/mqtt-mirror -h $MQTT_SERVER -d /var/state/mqtt -D
  ./code/mqtt-heating -h $MQTT_SERVER -d /var/state/mqtt -D

It's important to note that some shells leak memory so it's worth checking the
memory usage from time to time and possibly restart these.

All the configuration is in mqtt-heating. The LIGHT_IDS array contain the list
of devices whose light status indicates presence (typically those with a light
or with flaps open only when someone is present). All the timers are expressed
as HHMM for hours and minutes.
